# AERE 261 HW 3

Abhigyaan Deep

Hello grader of my homework. In order to preserve my sanity, I am trying out Markdown and $\LaTeX$ (GitHub flavored, src: https://github.com/tresabhi/isu-aer-e-261) to write this homework. Please let me know if I manage to not catch any rendering errors as I jam together $\LaTeX$, VSCode, and Chromium. My homeworks now should be a lot prettier ðŸ¤©
